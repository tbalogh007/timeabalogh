### Bio

Iâ€™m an assistant professor of political science at [The University of California, Davis](https://ps.ucdavis.edu/) where I research and teach on security, development, and research methods. In my research I often work with governments, international donors, and their implementing partners to improve the design and evaluation of development programming around the world. 

I was born in Cali, Colombia, grew up in Cali/South Florida, and have lived in Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, and now California.
